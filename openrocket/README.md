Model Rocket
============

Along with [my fork of OpenRocket](https://github.com/loic-fejoz/openrocket/tree/icesl-export), this is an project for testing what it would take to 3D print a model rocket as design in [OpenRocket](openrocket.info/) (a model rocket simulator).

The fun part is the modeling of the different kind of ogive with `implicit_solid`. The modeling of the [NACA airfoil](../naca-airfoil) was interesting too.

Also I believe that the [generated STL](test-marching-0_2.stl) might be used for finite-element simulation in order to compute drag.

Look how this one as an airfoil profile instead of a square one as in the second image.
