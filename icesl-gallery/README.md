### Involute of circle

The [involute of a circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute) [defined as
an](involute.lua) ```implicit_solid```.

### Pythagoras Tree

The classical Fractal / L-system [Pythagoras Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system#Example_2:_Pythagoras_Tree) defined recursively.

### Superquadrics

Defined by implicit surfaces that are superquadrics, ie ${distanceEstimator}({pt}, radius, p) = (abs({pt})^p)^\frac{1}{p} - radius$

For details, read appendix of [_Sphere tracing: a geometric method for the antialiased ray tracing of implicit surfaces_, John C. Hart](http://graphics.cs.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/zeno.pdf)

### Twisted Torus

Defined by an implicit surface, which is somehow a torus...

#### Second print

It is pretty nice to build even without support!

First print was a failure due to a bug in the G-Code and a buggy printer: I got a problem on the X axis while printing (and my printer is not properly calibrated yet)!
Please be aware that my printer has only a unique fan for the nozzle. Thus there is always one side that print better than the other. I shall upgrade it.

It can be pretty without support except where the previous problem occured. :-/
