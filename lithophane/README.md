Lithophane
==========

A simple test to convert an image into a [Lithophane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithophane) with 3D printing.,
all that within my favorite 3D modeling and slicing tool [IceSL](http://shapeforge.loria.fr/icesl/).

It has proved to be quite easy with ```implicit_solid``` and ```texture_3D``` features. It would be even easier when IceSL will have image loading into a 2D texture capability. Until then, to reproduce this, you will need to use a small converter of my own available at https://github.com/loic-fejoz/img2icesl
