Stone Castle
============

A simple trial of procedural modeling of a castle with warp shader for stones.

The stones of walls are randomly placed. Note that the algorithm has plenty of rooms for improvement.
A warp shader can be applied globally to give a rougher rendering of the stones. This is a special feature of [IceSL](http://www.loria.fr/~slefebvr/icesl/).

NB: I should print the small castle with warp shader for comparison.

It tooks my [FoldaRap](http://reprap.org/wiki/FoldaRap/fr) 8h54mn to print!
